/**
 * API/SERVER & PERSONALITY TEST CHALLENGE
 * 
 * This challenge is splitted into 2 parts. You have to make the button work.
 * As soon as the button works, it will lead you to a personality test.
 * This personality test will take 30-45 minutes, but once completed you get a very interesting analysis about your person.
 * I promise, it will be beneficial for yourself as well, no matter if you start working for Gavel or not.
 * It's definitely the most exciting personality test, I ever did â€“ it is made by RedBull for their best athletes.
 * 
 * Summed up:
 *  1) button click
 *  2) the app calls the local server at http://localhost:3000
 *  3) the local server calls my server at https://letsgavel.com
 *  4) button opens the returned URL in the browser
 *  5) you do the personality test there
 *  6) you send the PDF report to me
 * 
 * I would propose to start with:
 *  - checking out the API call below
 *  - checking out the endpoint of this call in the file ../../../server/src/api.js
 *  - understanding the response from my server at https://letsgavel.com
 *  - in this response you will find an explanation how to fix it
 *  - as soon as you get the right URL as a response from https://letsgavel.com,
 *  - you can forward it to the App and replace the Alert with an Linking.openURL
 * 
 * Hint: Doing the personality test is not part of the coding challenge anymore.
 * You do not have to do the personality test to submit your code challenge.
 * I would highly recommend it to you, but you can do it later on for example.
 *
 * If you finished with all 3 challenge screens, open http://localhost:3000 to submit your work
